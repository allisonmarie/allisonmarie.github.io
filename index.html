    <div class="subheader">
    <p>üåû SUMMER/FALL 2022 </p>
      </div>
    <p> I'm focused on creating positive change in my East Bay community through climate advocacy with 350 Bay Area (hosting a new monthly event series with the Mobilizing Team, and through my work on the 350BAA Board of Directors).
        I'm also building my consulting practice to support design and innovation projects for sustainabilty- and transportation-focused organizations.
        </p>
    
   <p>  <div class="subheader">
    <p>üåù CURRENT PROJECTS </p>
    </div><p> These main themes have been a constant in my life for a while now:
        </p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Honing and Sharing my Design Craft</b> <br> <span>I love this field and keeping up with its trends and innovations by engaging with the design community through events, conferences and learning opportunities ‚Äî¬†and I'm making more time too now for sharing it with others entering the field through mentoring junior designers and a public event series I host at work.</span> </li>
      <li><b>Community Involvement & Climate Justice</b> <br> <span>Climate change will have huge impacts on the East Bay community I love so much, and I'm so happy to have found a home for making an impact on this through my work with 350 Bay Area Action (where I serve on the board) and the Mobilizing Team (where I host a monthly action program). Always excited to talk with others about this!</span> </li>
      <li><b>Learning</b> <br> <span>Learning new things and upskilling lifelong passions always inspires me; currently, it's through dance classes, picking up the ukelele and maintaining my French duolingo streak.</span> </li>
      <li><b>Art & Music</b> <br> <span>This mostly means working on ceramic projects at my local studio these days, but I'm still tinkering with Ableton and my MIDI keyboard when I can.</span> </li>
      <li><b>On the Water / Out in the World</b> <br> <span">Getting out on the Bay brings me so much joy! I'm trying to make more time on weekends for ayaking, kiteboarding, and sailing again (plus I always love biking and scooting around town ‚Äî and advocating for better infrastructure for these things!)</span> </li>

    </ul>
