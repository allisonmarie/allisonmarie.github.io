      🌞 WINTER 2022-23
      </div>
    <p> In my design practice, I'm coming up on a decade of experience shipping beautiful user-centered solutions. 
      I bring a background in anthropology and a passion for working in close collaboration with others in agile frameworks — and with an MBA and product management experience under my belt as well, I'm also driven to ensure product strategy and processes are effective and impactful for business priorities. 
      I've also always loved mentoring designers entering the industry, so please get in touch!
      <br>
      <br>
      Outside of my design work, I'm focused on creating positive change in my East Bay community through climate advocacy with 350 Bay Area Action.
        I'm also building my consulting practice to support design and innovation projects for sustainability- and equity-focused organizations, and involved in a range of creative endeavors.  
        </p>
    <br>
   <div class="subheader"> 
  🌝 MY INTERESTS
    </div>
     <p> These main themes have been a constant in my life for a while now:
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>🖼 Honing & Sharing My Design Craft</strong><span>: I love this field and keeping up with its trends and innovations by engaging with the design community through events, conferences and learning opportunities —  and I'm making more time too now for sharing it with others entering the field through mentoring junior designers and a public event series I host at work.</span> </li>
        <li><strong>✊ Community-Building, Climate Justice & Sustainable Transportation</strong><span>: Climate change will have huge impacts on the East Bay community I love so much, and I'm so happy to have found a home for making an impact on this through my work with 350 Bay Area Action (where I serve on the board) and the Mobilizing Team (where I host a monthly action program). 
          I've always been especially passionate about advocating for sustainable transportation modes, and love biking and taking my e-scooter around town.
          Always excited to talk with others about this!</span> </li>
        <li><strong>🤓 Always Learning & Exploring the World</strong><span>: Learning new things and upskilling lifelong passions always inspires me — which probably helps explain all the different professional certifications I've pursued..! 
          Currently, it's through online design classes, picking up the ukelele and maintaining my French duolingo streak. 
          And whether finding a new secret stairway to climb in the Berkeley Hills or using my time off for a last-minute flight deal to Tahiti, I'm always exploring!</span> </li>
        <li><strong>💃🏻 Art, Music, Dance</strong><span>: This mostly means working on ceramic projects at my local studio these days, but I also love printmaking, am exploring new dance forms, and am still tinkering with Ableton and my MIDI keyboard when I can.</span> </li>
        <li><strong>⛵️ On the Water</strong><span>: I'm trying to make more time on weekends for kayaking, kiteboarding, and sailing again.</span> </li>

    </ul>
