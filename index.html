      MY WORK
      </div>
    <p> With <a href="http://www.allisonmariecooper.com">over a decade of experience in design</a>, I bring a background in anthropology and a passion for working in close collaboration with others in agile frameworks â€” and with an MBA and product management experience under my belt as well, I'm also driven to ensure product strategy and processes are effective and impactful for business priorities. 
      
     <br>
      <br>
        I also work with early-stage startups and nonprofits through my <a href="https://www.seetheforest.org/">consulting practice (See the Forest)</a> to support design and innovation projects related to climate solutions.
