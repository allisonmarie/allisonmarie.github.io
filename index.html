    <p> With <a href="http://www.allisonmariecooper.com">over a decade of experience in design</a>, I bring a background in anthropology and a passion for working in close collaboration with others in agile frameworks â€” and with an MBA and product management experience under my belt as well, I'm also driven to ensure product strategy and processes are effective and impactful for business priorities.
