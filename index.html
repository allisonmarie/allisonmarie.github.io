  <h1>Hey there!</h1>
  <p> I'm Allison. Welcome to my home base on the internet. </p>
</div>
  
  <body>
    <p> I'm Allison, and I'm a product manager, designer and sustainability advocate based in the East Bay.
    </p>  
    <p> I recently left my role as a Product Manager / Sr. Designer working on innovation in the mobility/future-of-transportation technology space at Goodyear's SF Innovation Lab in order to make time to figure out what I want to focus on next. </p>
    <p> I also wanted to make more time to impact the most important challenges of the current moment — climate change and the upcoming election — and am leading solidarity efforts for the 350 Bay Area Mobilizing Team, getting involved with Sunrise Movement and Climate Reality Project, finishing up a fellowship with the Clean Energy Leadership Institute, and studying foresight, transportation planning and cities. </p>
    <p> In addition, I serve as Chair of the El Cerrito Arts & Culture Commission and also enjoy biking, kiteboarding, sailing, traveling, reading and making ceramic art. </p>
