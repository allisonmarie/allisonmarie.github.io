      MY WORK
      </div>
    <p> Now with <a href="http://www.allisonmariecooper.com">a decade of experience in design</a>, I loved deepening my expertise in conversion and monetization in my last role. 
      I bring a background in anthropology and a passion for working in close collaboration with others in agile frameworks â€” and with an MBA and product management experience under my belt as well, I'm also driven to ensure product strategy and processes are effective and impactful for business priorities. 
      I've also always loved mentoring designers entering the industry, so please get in touch!
      <br>
      <br>
        I'm also building my <a href="https://www.seetheforest.studio/">consulting practice</a> to support design and innovation projects for sustainability- and equity-focused organizations, and involved in a range of creative endeavors.  
        </p>

  MY INTERESTS
    </div>
     <p> Outside of my design work, I'm focused on creating positive change in my East Bay community through climate advocacy and community-building work, and engaging in my creative practices of dance and other media.
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Honing & sharing my design craft</b>: There's always so much more to learn in this field</li>
        <li><b>Always learning and exploring the world:</b> I get so much inspiration from being reminded how big and small the world is </li>
        <li><b>Art, Music, Dance: </b>I love to complement my design practice with other creative pursuits </li>
        <li><b>Weekends on the water:</b> Sailing as much as possible!</li>
