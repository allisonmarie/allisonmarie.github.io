     <p>Here's what I'm up to lately... please reach out to connect about any of these!
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>🎨 Product Design:</b> I've worked for over 10 years now as a product designer, and am currently looking for my next full-time role! Reach out for my <a href="https://www.allisonmariecooper.com/">portfolio</a> password to talk more.</li>
        <li><b>🎨 Creative exploration:</b> Also always excited to chat about art (lately: <a href="https://westernwindowstudio.com/">ceramics</a>, and <a href="http://allison.pictures/">printmaking and illustration</a>), music (I play piano and dabble in learning other instruments), and dance (mostly flamenco!). Plus, I've always loved vintage fashion/collecting, and have been enjoying selling vintage online — reach out for my depop links :)</li>
        <li><b>🌱 Climate Innovation Consulting:</b> I support design and innovation strategy for climate solutions as <a href="https://www.seetheforest.org/">See the Forest Consulting</a>.</li>
        <li><b>🌱 Climate Sailors:</b> Combining my passion for climate work with my love of sailing, I'm building a group for those who share these passions to get together.</li>
        <li><b>🤝 Teaching & Coaching:</b> Throughout my design career, I've loved to host workshops and provide mentorship for junior designers, including guest speaking and facilitating self-confidence workshops to California College of the Arts Design and DMBA students. In 2025-2026, I'll be teaching two courses at CCA — so excited to share more on this soon!</li>
        <li><b>🤝 Writing & publishing books:</b> I've been exploring children's books in particular, please let me know if you have experience in this and want to collaborate!</li>
</ul>
