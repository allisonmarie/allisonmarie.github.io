  <h1>Hey there!</h1>
  <p> I'm Allison. Welcome to my home base on the internet. </p>

  <body>
    <p> I'm a product manager, designer and sustainability advocate based in the East Bay. </p>

    <p> WHAT I'M UP TO </p>
    <p> I recently left my role as a Product Manager / Sr. Designer working on innovation in the mobility/future-of-transportation technology space at Goodyear's SF Innovation Lab in order to make time to figure out what I want to focus on next. </p>
    <p> I also wanted to make more time to impact the most important challenges of the current moment — climate change and the upcoming election — and am leading solidarity efforts for the 350 Bay Area Mobilizing Team, getting involved with Sunrise Movement and Climate Reality Project, finishing up a fellowship with the Clean Energy Leadership Institute, and studying foresight, transportation planning and cities. </p>
    <p> In addition, I serve as Chair of my city's Arts & Culture Commission and also enjoy biking, kiteboarding, sailing, traveling, reading and making ceramic art. </p>

    <p> BIO </p>
  </div>
    
    <p> Originally from the East Bay, I was involved in sustainability efforts in high school before heading to Montréal to study at McGill University (BA Honours, Anthropology, Environment minor). 
      After graduating, I worked for a year managing the administration of the Students' Society's building and hundreds of student clubs and services as McGill's VP Clubs & Services before moving back home to the Bay Area, where I soon realized I needed to learn about tech to make a home here. 
    I attended all the tech events I could find, including my first hackathon, where I pitched a concept and led a world-class team to win the event. 
      This crash course in entrepreneurship led me to the world of UX research and design, and I've now owned end-to-end full-stack product design processes at fast-growing early-stage startups as well as Fortune 500 innovation labs.
    </p> 
    <p> Seeking more involvement in the strategy, visioning and roadmapping of the products I worked on, I went to California College of the Arts' innovative MBA program, which emphasizes design strategy and technology, and grew into a Product Manager. I'm now interested in PM or Sr. Designer roles as I'm motivated by building products people use and love and I've found opportunities to make meaningful impact in both roles.
