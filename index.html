  <h1>Hey there!</h1>
  <p> I'm Allison. I'm a Bay Area-based strategy specialist and creative generalist, passionate about clean energy and local policy. </p>
</div>
  
  <body>    
    <p> I recently left my role working on innovation in mobility & future-of-transportation tech at Goodyear's San Francisco Innovation Lab (where I was Product Manager / Sr. Designer of the <a href="http://www.andgonow.com"> <u> AndGo by Goodyear</u> </a> platform) in order to make time to figure out what I want to focus on next. </p>
    <p> I also wanted to make more time to impact the most important challenges of the current moment — climate change and the upcoming election — and am leading solidarity efforts for the 350 Bay Area Mobilizing Team, getting involved with Sunrise Movement and Climate Reality Project, finishing up a fellowship with the Clean Energy Leadership Institute, and studying foresight, transportation planning and cities. 
      In addition, I serve as Chair of my city's Arts & Culture Commission and also enjoy biking, kiteboarding, sailing, traveling, reading, screenprinting and making ceramic art. </p>
<p> I'm now interested in PM or Sr. Designer roles as I'm motivated by building products people use and love and I've found opportunities to make meaningful impact in both roles.

    <p> A BIT MORE ABOUT ME </p>
    </div>
    
    <p> Originally from the East Bay, I was involved in local sustainability efforts before heading to Montréal to study at McGill University (BA Anthropology, Environment minor). 
      After graduating, I managed the Students' Society's building and hundreds of student clubs and services as McGill's VP Clubs & Services before moving back home to the Bay Area, where I soon realized I needed to learn about tech to make a home. 
    I attended all the tech events I could find, including my first hackathon, where I pitched a concept and led a world-class team to win the event. 
      This crash course in entrepreneurship led me to the world of UX research and design, and I've now owned end-to-end full-stack product design processes at fast-growing early-stage startups as well as Fortune 500 innovation labs.
    </p> 
    <p> Seeking more involvement in the strategy, visioning and roadmapping of the products I worked on, I went to California College of the Arts' innovative MBA program, which emphasizes design strategy and technology, and grew into a Product Manager role. 
      I've also completed Product Management and Agile Project Management coursework from UC Berkeley Extension and Stanford Executive Education. </p>
