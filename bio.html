      A bit more about me

  <body>    
    
    <p> 
      Originally from the Berkeley area, I was involved in local sustainability efforts before moving to Montréal to study at McGill University (BA Anthropology, Environment minor). 
      After graduating, I managed the Students' Society's building and hundreds of student clubs and services as McGill's VP Clubs & Services before moving back home to the Bay Area, where I soon realized I needed to learn about tech to make a home here. 
      I attended all the tech events I could find, including my first hackathon, where I pitched a concept and led a world-class team to win the event. 
      This crash course in entrepreneurship led me to the world of UX research and design, and I've now owned end-to-end full-stack product design processes at fast-growing early-stage startups as well as Fortune 500 innovation labs.
    </p>
    <p> Seeking more involvement in product strategy, visioning and roadmapping than I'd found in pure UI Design roles, I attended California College of the Arts' innovative MBA program, which emphasizes design strategy and technology innovation, and grew into more formal product management roles. I've also completed Product Management and Agile Project Management coursework from UC Berkeley Extension and Stanford Executive Education. 
    </p>
    <p> I'm most excited now about making an impact as a strategic, "full-stack" user-centered product designer or product manager depending on how the role is set up — or ideally getting to do some of both at a small team/growing startup.
