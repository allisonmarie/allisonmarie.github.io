    <p> WHAT I'M UP TO | APRIL 2021 </p>
      </div>
    
      <p>I work as a Software Product Manager at SunPower while deepening my involvement in clean energy advocacy through 350 Bay Area & 350BA Action, and giving back to the amazing Clean Energy Leadership Institute community by volunteering on the Bay Area 2021 Selections Committee.
        <br>
        <br>
        My continued involvement with the El Cerrito Arts and Culture Commission has been a highlight of my life lately, as I've gotten to meet the most incredible, interesting people in my community like our new Poet Laureate, as well as seeing our Utility Box Pilot program artwork go up and joining an exceptional Senior Stroll.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm also still going for lots of neighborhood walks and finally have a new keyboard set up to play around more with my musical goals, and reading up on racial justice and social movements (please share any suggestions!).
        </p>
    
   <p>  <div class="subheader">
    <p> CURRENT PROJECTS </p>
    </div>
    <p> I stay involved in various projects applying my passions for public policy advocacy and community engagement: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Climate Action & Policy: </b>This is my top priority. To do this, I'm working with 350 Bay Area's Mobilizing Team, promoting building electrification with the local Policy Squad of the Climate Reality Project, and learning about the California legislative process conducting policy research and tracking bills with the 350 Bay Area Action Legislative Team - Clean Energy Action group.</li>
      <li><b>Arts & Culture Commission: </b>The now over two years I've served on this commission have been a fascinating introduction to city governance and programming, and now as Chair I'm more involved in directing the agenda and our priorities. Stay tuned for more public art programs in El Cerrito! I'm really proud of the Utility Box Pilot Program and new Poet Laureate we've recently introduced.</li>
      <li><b>Futures Thinking: </b>I'm finally more deeply engaging with this interest area by attending workshops with Kedge.</li>
      <li><b>Women in Cleantech & Sustainability: </b>I'm having a really inspiring experience participating as a mentee in the Spring 2021 Mentorship cohort.</li>
      <li><b>Clean Energy Leadership Institute: </b>I'm so excited to get to give back to this amazing org by serving on the San Francisco 2021 Selection Committee!</li>
      <li><b>Local Pedestrian and Biking Advocacy: </b>TBD what exactly this will look like; still exploring opportunities for involvement in my city.</li>
    </ul>

      A BIT MORE ABOUT ME 
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <p> 
      Originally from the Berkeley area, I was involved in local sustainability efforts before moving to Montréal to study at McGill University (BA Anthropology, Environment minor). 
      After graduating, I managed the Students' Society's building and hundreds of student clubs and services as McGill's VP Clubs & Services before moving back home to the Bay Area, where I soon realized I needed to learn about tech to make a home here. 
      I attended all the tech events I could find, including my first hackathon, where I pitched a concept and led a world-class team to win the event. 
      This crash course in entrepreneurship led me to the world of UX research and design, and I've now owned end-to-end full-stack product design processes at fast-growing early-stage startups as well as Fortune 500 innovation labs.
    </p>
    <p> Seeking more involvement in product strategy, visioning and roadmapping than I'd found in pure UI Design roles, I attended California College of the Arts' innovative MBA program, which emphasizes design strategy and technology innovation, and grew into more formal product management roles. I've also completed Product Management and Agile Project Management coursework from UC Berkeley Extension and Stanford Executive Education. 
    </p>
    <p> I'm most excited now about making an impact as a strategic, "full-stack" user-centered product designer or product manager depending on how the role is set up — or ideally getting to do some of both at a small team/growing startup. 
    </p> 
    <p> 
      My product design portfolio can be found here:
