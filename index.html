    <p> WHAT I'M UP TO: SEPT/OCT 2020 </p>
    </div>
   <p> Since leaving my role as Product Manager of future-of-mobility tech at Goodyear's San Francisco Innovation Lab (working on the <a href="http://www.andgonow.com"> <u> AndGo by Goodyear</u> </a> platform), I've been exploring how I can best impact the climate catastrophe and crucial upcoming election — and my theory of change has now shifted.</p>
    <p> Through work with various local environmental advocacy groups and my fellowship with the Clean Energy Leadership Institute, and now as I'm studying foresight, transportation planning and cities while exploring new roles, I'm seeing more than ever how we need policy intervention to be able to combat the climate crisis as fast as is required.</p>
    <p> I'm still excited about the right PM or Sr. Designer role as I'm motivated by building products people use and love and I've found opportunities to make meaningful impact in both roles, but I'm taking the time too to dive into policy opportunities in this space.

      A BIT MORE ABOUT ME 
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <p> 
      Originally from the East Bay, I was involved in local sustainability efforts before heading to Montréal to study at McGill University (BA Anthropology, Environment minor). 
      After graduating, I managed the Students' Society's building and hundreds of student clubs and services as McGill's VP Clubs & Services before moving back home to the Bay Area, where I soon realized I needed to learn about tech to make a home here. 
      I attended all the tech events I could find, including my first hackathon, where I pitched a concept and led a world-class team to win the event. 
      This crash course in entrepreneurship led me to the world of UX research and design, and I've now owned end-to-end full-stack product design processes at fast-growing early-stage startups as well as Fortune 500 innovation labs.
    </p>

      WHAT'S NEXT
    </p>
    </div>
    <p> 
      Seeking more involvement in product strategy, visioning and roadmapping than I'd found in pure UI Design roles, I attended California College of the Arts' innovative MBA program, which emphasizes design strategy and technology, and grew into a Product Manager role. 
      I've also completed Product Management and Agile Project Management coursework from UC Berkeley Extension and Stanford Executive Education. 
      I'm now most passionate about making an impact as a "full-stack" product strategist, whether that's found in a designer or product manager role.
    </p>
    <p> I'm now interested in PM or Sr. Designer roles as I'm motivated by building products people use and love and I've found opportunities to make meaningful impact in both roles.

    <p> CURRENT PROJECTS (SEPTEMBER 2020) </p>
    </div>
    <p> A bit more about the different projects I'm involved with now: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Climate Action & Policy: </b>This is my top priority. To do this, I've been doing a ton of research into local groups and how I can be effective; so far, I'm working with 350 Bay Area's Mobilizing Team, getting trained with the Climate Reality Project, and am getting involved with Sunrise Bay Area.</li>
      <li><b>Democratic Organizing in Contra Costa County: </b>I'm a volunteer on the field strategy team of our county's Coordinated Campaign to support progressive candidates up and down the ballet. It's been an amazing learning experience for me — a crash course in phone bank captaining and everything that happens behind the scenes to endorse and support candidates.</li>
      <li><b>Transportation Planning Graduate Certificate: </b>I've been designing my own education around my passion for transportation/urban planning for a while now, and was so excited to find this program at San Jose State where I could formalize a foundational learning experience in this space. With online classes one night a week, it's an awesome</li>
      <li><b>Future-of-Mobility & Clean Energy Events & Conferences: </b>I'm so happy to have more time to plug into all the amazing conversations happening on these key interests! My fellowship with the Clean Energy Leadership Insitute just ended (and was an incredible experience) and I'm excited to continue to be involved as an alum there too.</li>
      <li><b>Arts & Culture Commission: </b>The now over two years I've served on this commission have been a fascinating introduction to city governance and programming, and now as Chair I'm more involved in directing the agenda and our priorities.</li>
      <li><b>General learning and exploration: </b>I feel so lucky to have this time to focus on learning and exploring what I want to do next. In addition to the bigger projects above, I've also been catching up on coursera courses and other trainings in my professional development backlog.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> I also enjoy biking, kiteboarding, sailing, traveling, reading, screenprinting and making ceramic art. </p>
