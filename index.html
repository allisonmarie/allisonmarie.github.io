  MY WORK
      </div>
    <p> Now with a decade of experience in design, I loved deepening my expertise in conversion and monetization in my last role. 
      I bring a background in anthropology and a passion for working in close collaboration with others in agile frameworks ‚Äî and with an MBA and product management experience under my belt as well, I'm also driven to ensure product strategy and processes are effective and impactful for business priorities. 
      I've also always loved mentoring designers entering the industry, so please get in touch!
      <br>
      <br>
        I'm also building my consulting practice to support design and innovation projects for sustainability- and equity-focused organizations, and involved in a range of creative endeavors.  
        </p>
    <br>
   <div class="subheader"> 
  MY INTERESTS
    </div>
     <p> Outside of my design work, I'm focused on creating positive change in my East Bay community through climate advocacy and community-building work, and engaging in my creative practices of dance and other media.
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Honing & Sharing My Design Craft</b><span>:<br> I love this field and keeping up with its trends and innovations by engaging with the design community through events, conferences and learning opportunities ‚Äî  and I'm making more time too now for sharing it with others entering the field through mentoring junior designers and engaging with emerging AI tools.</span> </li>
        <li><b>Community-Building, Climate Justice & Sustainable Transportation</b><span>:<br> I'm exploring new homes for my climate activism; I've always been especially passionate about advocating for sustainable transportation modes, and love biking and taking my e-scooter around town ‚Äî¬†please be in touch to chat about this!</span> </li>
        <li><b>Always Learning & Exploring the World</b><span>:<br> Learning new things and upskilling lifelong passions always inspires me ‚Äî which probably helps explain all the different professional certifications I've pursued..! </span> </li>
        <li><b>Art, Music, Dance</b><span>:<br> This mostly means working on ceramic projects at my local studio these days, but I also love printmaking, am exploring new dance forms, and am still tinkering with Ableton/MIDI/bass/ukelele/keyboard when I can.</span> </li>
        <li><b>On the Water</b><span>:<br> I'm trying to make more time on weekends for kayaking, kiteboarding, and sailing again.</span> </li>
    </ul>
